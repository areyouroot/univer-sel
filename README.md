# BOOT TO ROOT

## so rules should be like (in this entire document ignore grammer and spelling)

### you can do anything as long as you dont break the system (because its cresents property)
### smart people use Chatgpt, legends use bard (easy to break)

## Round 1 Warm UP welcome to digital world
### so real hacker hack the people first not the computer so this is going to be a warm up round where we will gather the information regarding the people.

    Fun fact - the internet is splited in to 3 parts surface,deep and dark net.

    1. so get your partner or friends any social media account with permission, make sure its not private (eg:Insta, facebook, twitter etc ...) and try to gather nasty informations like Date of birth, real name, friends, crush(just kidding), work, phone number etc.......
    
        max time is 10-15 min to get account and perform.
        make sure that u are doing everything legal
        if u dont have any friends or no one in the workshop is ready to give their acc then perform at ur celebrity crush
        make it as fun game dont harm anyone thankyou....
        dont send messages or phishing links or try to hack active. passive informations is only allowed.
    
    hints and help - 

        Google dorks can be used
        college and other institues are bad at handeling files like docs pdf xl so search for those files (even indian gov is bad at it.)
        gpt trained by tweeter is based on tweets soooooo
        bonus - sometimes people post emotions in form of story and status etc ......
        u can use online emulators like gdb to execute bash scripts and tools (harvestor , whoami etc ...)
    
## Round 2 this is how a script kiddy becomes man

    so a real hacker does not rely on others tools he builds own and uses.

    ETA - 30 - 45 min

    fun fact - both vim and arch linux are hard to use and arch linux is the most advance os (bleeding edge)in the world that nvdia and other hardware developers test all the workings and software in arch linux before developing for the windows.

    make sure u comment properly and leave space to improve the readablity use oops even its a interpreted language like proper class name and method names and return type.
    each method should not contain more than 10 lines look at code reusablity.
    limit the usage of variables.

    1. build a network scanner that scans every ip in the current local network and prints the ip that are active

    hint - ping every ip in the local network if it reply its active automate this process

    2. build a shell executor that execute system commands when launched via the localhost.

    hint - not exact product but u can take reference - https://github.com/areyouroot/pieshell/blob/main/pieshell%20v2.0.py

## Round 3 areyouroot ?

    ETA - 15 min (optional round)

    this round is a xss game round 

    XSS - cross site scripting is a web based attack google to learn futher

    go to https://xss-game.appspot.com/ play this game and win.

## Round 4 Collateral damage

    ETA - 1 hrs - 1.30 hrs

    fun fact - some orgs pay you for reporting the bug and some org case a lawsuit to hacking them. there are platfoms who help us like hackerone etc.....

    So developers make stuff, real hackers break the stuff and force it to things that it was never ment to do. so break code not heart or law

    so this round u can download any opesource code dopwnload it and try to build it compile it then break it...

    u can use oly debugger and perform overflow attacks use google and youtube try to give invalid inputs and make the stuff to break.

    some eg scripts that u can use 

    https://github.com/shubhamkumar27/Face_recognition_based_attendance_system
    https://github.com/CT83/SmoothStream
    https://github.com/hackstarsj/django-ecommerce-project-amazon-clone
    https://github.com/shsarv/Machine-Learning-Projects
    https://github.com/Vatshayan/Live-Chatbot-for-Final-Year-Project

    remember if u take the orgs code like firefox google they will pay you as well for reporting the bug


    # Thank You

    note - use python or js based code they are easy to build else download nasa html code and hack nasa code using html.
